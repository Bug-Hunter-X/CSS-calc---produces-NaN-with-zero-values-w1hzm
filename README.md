This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with the CSS `calc()` function where using a calculation that results in zero can lead to `NaN` (Not a Number) in some browsers.  This often happens when dealing with expressions where a unitless zero is involved in a multiplication, division or subtraction operation. This is an uncommon error because it's highly dependent on the specific mathematical operations within `calc()`. The solution showcases how to avoid this by explicitly ensuring that numbers within `calc()` have units or by using alternative methods to compute zero values.
