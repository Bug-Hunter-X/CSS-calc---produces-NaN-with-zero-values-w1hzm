Instead of using a multiplication that results in zero, use the unit directly.  For instance, instead of `calc(0 * 10px)`, use `0px`.  Or, If you need to dynamically adjust values and still handle possible zero results, use conditional statements or pre-processing to handle the zero case separately.  You could use CSS variables (custom properties) and JavaScript to calculate the values before applying them to the styles.  This provides more control and makes it simpler to avoid `NaN`.  Ensure that you use proper units in your `calc()` expressions to prevent unexpected behavior.  Avoid situations where a unitless zero could lead to the zero value.
